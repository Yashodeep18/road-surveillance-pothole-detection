# Road Surveillance Pothole Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Road Surveillance Pothole Detection** system is designed to detect potholes on roads using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project helps in identifying road surface anomalies, improving road safety, and enabling timely maintenance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for scripting and machine learning)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning model)
- **YOLOv5/SSD/MobileNet** (for object detection)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
